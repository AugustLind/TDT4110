      "moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\n",

      "sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\n",
      "away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\n",
      "say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\n",

      "hanging from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\n",
      "and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\n",

      "wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\n",
      "solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\n",
      "and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\n",
      "doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\n",
      "the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\n",
      "them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\n",
      "curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\n",
      "door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\n",
      "in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\n",
      "passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\n",
      "looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\n",
      "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\n",
      "among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\n",
      "she could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if\n",
      "my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\n",
      "very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\n",
      "I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\n",
      "know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\n",
      "had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\n",
      "things indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\n",
      "went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\n",
      "it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\n",
      "telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\n",
      "certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\n",
      "of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\n",
      "beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\n",
      "Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\n",
      "first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\n",
      "for she had read several nice little histories about children who\n",
      "had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\n",
      "things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\n",
      "their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\n",
      "will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\n",
      "never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n",
      "`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\n",
      "later.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\n",
      "to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\n",
      "of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\n",
      "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\n",
      "it off.\n",

      "  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\n",
      "like a telescope.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\n",
      "her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\n",
      "size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\n",
      "First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\n",
      "going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\n",
      "this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\n",

      "like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\n",
      "like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\n",
      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\n",
      "on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!\n",
      "when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\n",
      "little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\n",
      "she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\n",
      "quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\n",
      "up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying,\n",
      "the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\n",
      "herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\n",
      "She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\n",
      "seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\n",
      "severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\n",
      "trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\n",
      "of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\n",
      "child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\n",
      "use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\n",
      "there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\n",
      "person!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\n",
      "the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\n",
      "which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\n",
      "`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\n",
      "I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\n",
      "under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\n",
      "don't care which happens!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\n",
      "way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\n",
      "feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\n",
      "find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally\n",
      "happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\n",

      "a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in\n",
      "the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\n",
      "behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\n",

      "she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that\n",
      "it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n",

      "trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\n",
      "this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\n",
      "(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:\n",

      "mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\n",
      "eyes, but it said nothing.\n",

      "no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she\n",

      "her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\n",
      "water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\n",
      "your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\n",
      "poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n",

      "as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\n",
      "nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\n",
      "she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital\n",
      "one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,\n",
      "for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt\n",

      "more if you'd rather not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end\n",
      "of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family\n",
      "always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\n",
      "the name again!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the\n",
      "subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\n",

      "such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!\n",
      "A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly\n",
      "brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and\n",
      "it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I\n",
      "can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\n",
      "know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\n",
      "He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the\n",
      "Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\n",
      "making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\n",
      "again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\n",
      "like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam\n",
      "slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\n",
      "thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\n",
      "the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\n",
      "understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n",
      "\n",

      "with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a\n",
      "Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious\n",

      "uncomfortable.\n",

      "  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they\n",
      "had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed\n",
      "quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with\n",
      "them, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had\n",
      "quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\n",
      "and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\n",

      "soon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large\n",
      "ring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyes\n",

      "you doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of\n",

      "upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,\n",

      "gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going\n",
      "messages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on\n",
      "messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that\n",
      "would happen:  `\"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready\n",
      "for your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see\n",

      "on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering\n",
      "people about like that!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with\n",
      "a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two\n",
      "or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and\n",
      "a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when\n",
      "her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-\n",
      "glass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'\n",
      "but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know\n",
      "SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,\n",
      "`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this\n",
      "bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for\n",
      "really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:\n",
      "before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing\n",
      "against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being\n",
      "broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself\n",
      "`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I\n",
      "can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so\n",
      "much!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and\n",
      "growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in\n",
      "another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried\n",
      "the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the\n",
      "other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,\n",
      "as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one\n",
      "foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,\n",
      "whatever happens.  What WILL become of me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full\n",
      "effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,\n",
      "and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting\n",
      "out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\n",
      "wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about\n",
      "by mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that\n",
      "rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,\n",
      "this sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\n",
      "When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing\n",
      "never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There\n",
      "ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when\n",
      "I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more\n",
      "HERE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I\n",
      "am now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--\n",
      "but then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'\n",

      "\n",
      "  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,\n",

      "minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves\n",
      "this moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the\n",

      "she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she\n",
      "was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no\n",
      "reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;\n",
      "but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed\n",
      "hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it\n",
      "say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she\n",
      "fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly\n",
      "spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not\n",
      "get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\n",
      "and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\n",
      "just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something\n",
      "of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are\n",
      "you?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then\n",
      "I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!\n",
      "Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.')\n",
      "\n",
      "  `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why, it\n",
      "fills the whole window!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it\n",
      "away!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear\n",
      "whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer\n",
      "honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\n",
      "last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in\n",
      "the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more\n",
      "sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there\n",
      "must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\n",
      "pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I\n",
      "don't want to stay in here any longer!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at\n",
      "last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\n",
      "good many voices all talking together:  she made out the words:\n",
      "`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\n",
      "Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up\n",
      "at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half\n",
      "high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--\n",

      "I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is\n",
      "narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and\n",
      "waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what\n",
      "sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close\n",
      "above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one\n",
      "sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes\n",
      "Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the\n",
      "hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold\n",
      "up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?\n",

      "Dinah at you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\n",
      "sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\n",
      "began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A\n",
      "barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\n",
      "doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came\n",
      "rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\n",
      "`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\n",
      "`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\n",
      "turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\n",
      "idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she\n",
      "thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it\n",
      "can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I\n",
      "suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find\n",
      "that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\n",
      "enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\n",
      "found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\n",
      "The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by\n",
      "two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\n",
      "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she\n",
      "ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\n",
      "thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\n",
      "and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\n",
      "I think that will be the best plan.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\n",
      "simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the\n",
      "smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering\n",
      "about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over\n",
      "her head made her look up in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round\n",
      "eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\n",
      "`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\n",
      "hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\n",
      "time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\n",
      "would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of\n",
      "stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\n",
      "into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,\n",
      "and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice\n",

      "its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very\n",
      "like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\n",
      "again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\n",
      "stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long\n",
      "way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat\n",
      "down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\n",
      "mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\n",
      "so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.\n",
      "In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its\n",
      "mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got\n",
      "down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely\n",
      "remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and\n",
      "the other side will make you grow shorter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",

      "  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a\n",
      "minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as\n",
      "it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.\n",
      "However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they\n",
      "would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a\n",
      "little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment\n",
      "she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her\n",
      "foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but\n",
      "she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking\n",
      "rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.\n",
      "Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was\n",
      "hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and\n",
      "managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\n",
      "\n",

      "  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of\n",
      "delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she\n",
      "found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could\n",
      "see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which\n",
      "seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay\n",
      "far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where\n",
      "HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I\n",
      "can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no\n",
      "result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the\n",
      "distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her\n",
      "head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted\n",
      "to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,\n",
      "like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a\n",
      "graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which\n",
      "she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she\n",
      "had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a\n",
      "hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating\n",
      "her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more\n",
      "subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every\n",
      "way, and nothing seems to suit them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've\n",
      "tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but\n",
      "those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no\n",
      "use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the\n",
      "Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and\n",
      "day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was\n",
      "beginning to see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued\n",
      "the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was\n",
      "thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come\n",
      "wriggling down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'm\n",
      "a--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can see you're\n",
      "trying to invent something!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\n",
      "remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the\n",
      "deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my\n",
      "time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a\n",
      "serpent; and there's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be\n",
      "telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very\n",
      "truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as\n",
      "serpents do, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why\n",
      "then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent\n",
      "for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of\n",
      "adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and\n",
      "what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a\n",
      "serpent?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm\n",
      "not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't\n",
      "want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it\n",
      "settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the\n",
      "trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\n",
      "among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\n",
      "untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the\n",
      "pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very\n",
      "carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\n",
      "growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,\n",
      "that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a\n",
      "few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,\n",
      "there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes\n",
      "are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to\n",
      "another!  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next\n",
      "thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be\n",
      "done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an\n",
      "open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n",
      "`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come\n",
      "upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their\n",
      "wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did\n",

      "\n",
      "  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\n",
      "that for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\n",
      "door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise\n",
      "inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was\n",
      "a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling\n",
      "and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\n",
      "or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went\n",
      "on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\n",
      "instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\n",
      "you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time\n",
      "he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\n",
      "perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so\n",
      "VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\n",
      "answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate\n",
      "came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just\n",
      "grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees\n",
      "behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,\n",
      "exactly as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's the\n",
      "first question, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.\n",
      "`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the\n",

      "\n",
      "  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for\n",
      "repeating his remark, with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he\n",

      "\n",
      "  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.\n",

      "  `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:\n",
      "`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of\n",
      "smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a\n",
      "three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was\n",
      "leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to\n",
      "be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to\n",
      "herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the\n",
      "Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was\n",
      "sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The\n",
      "only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,\n",
      "and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from\n",
      "ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for\n",
      "she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to\n",
      "speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.  Pig!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice\n",
      "quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed\n",
      "to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on\n",
      "again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I\n",
      "didn't know that cats COULD grin.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,\n",
      "feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought\n",
      "it would be as well to introduce some other subject of\n",
      "conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took\n",
      "the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work\n",
      "throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\n",
      "--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,\n",
      "plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when\n",
      "they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it\n",
      "was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up\n",
      "and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS\n",
      "nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very\n",
      "nearly carried it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a\n",
      "hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it\n",
      "does.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very\n",
      "glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her\n",
      "knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day\n",
      "and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn\n",
      "round on its axis--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant\n",
      "to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and\n",
      "seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four\n",
      "hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  I--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide\n",
      "figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again,\n",
      "singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a\n",
      "violent shake at the end of every line:\n",
      "\n",

      "get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of\n",
      "the room.  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,\n",
      "but it just missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-\n",

      "directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.  The poor\n",
      "little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,\n",
      "and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,\n",
      "so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much\n",
      "as she could do to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,\n",
      "(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep\n",
      "tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its\n",
      "undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I\n",
      "don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure\n",
      "to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it\n",
      "behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing\n",
      "grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't\n",
      "grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing\n",
      "yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into\n",
      "its face to see what was the matter with it.  There could be no\n",
      "doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout\n",
      "than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for\n",
      "a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at\n",
      "all.  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked\n",
      "into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "  No, there were no tears.  `If you're going to turn into a pig,\n",
      "my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do\n",
      "with you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or\n",
      "grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for\n",
      "some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I\n",
      "to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted\n",
      "again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some\n",
      "alarm.  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was\n",
      "neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be\n",

      "\n",
      "  So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to\n",

      "but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began\n",

      "\n",
      "  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.  It looked good-\n",

      "  `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",

      "long enough.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,\n",
      "`lives a Hatter:  and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,\n",

      "\n",
      "  `I suppose so,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's\n",
      "angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm\n",
      "pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.\n",

      "did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the\n",
      "direction in which the March Hare was said to live.  `I've seen\n",
      "hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be\n",
      "much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be\n",
      "raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said\n",

      "it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.  `I told you butter\n",
      "wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March\n",
      "Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter\n",
      "grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then\n",
      "he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he\n",
      "could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It\n",
      "was the BEST butter, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.\n",
      "`What a funny watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the\n",
      "month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch tell\n",
      "you what year it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's\n",
      "because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to\n",
      "have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.\n",
      "`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured\n",
      "a little hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without\n",
      "opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to\n",
      "remark myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to\n",
      "Alice again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better\n",
      "with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that\n",
      "have no answers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you\n",
      "wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head\n",
      "contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to\n",
      "beat time when I learn music.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand\n",
      "beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do\n",
      "almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose\n",
      "it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:\n",
      "you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the\n",
      "clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a\n",
      "whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:\n",
      "`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep\n",
      "it to half-past one as long as you liked.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.\n",
      "`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'\n",
      "(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the\n",
      "great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "            \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "            How I wonder what you're at!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "            \"Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "            Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "                    Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n",
      "`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that\n",
      "they had to pinch it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,\n",
      "`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the\n",
      "time!  Off with his head!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,\n",
      "`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so\n",
      "many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always\n",
      "tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice\n",
      "ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,\n",
      "yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady\n",
      "tells us a story.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at\n",
      "the proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,\n",
      "Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he\n",
      "said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows\n",
      "were saying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep\n",
      "again before it's done.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the\n",
      "Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,\n",
      "Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great\n",
      "interest in questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a\n",
      "minute or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently\n",
      "remarked; `they'd have been ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways\n",
      "of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went\n",
      "on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very\n",
      "earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so\n",
      "I can't take more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very\n",
      "easy to take MORE than nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked\n",
      "triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped\n",
      "herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the\n",
      "Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the\n",
      "bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and\n",
      "then said, `It was a treacle-well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but\n",
      "the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse\n",
      "sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the\n",
      "story for yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt\n",
      "again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he\n",
      "consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they\n",
      "were learning to draw, you know--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move\n",
      "one place on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the\n",
      "March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather\n",
      "unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the\n",
      "only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a\n",
      "good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset\n",
      "the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began\n",
      "very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw\n",
      "the treacle from?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so\n",
      "I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,\n",
      "stupid?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not\n",
      "choosing to notice this last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse\n",
      "go on for some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and\n",
      "rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew\n",
      "all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why with an M?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why not?' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going\n",
      "off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up\n",
      "again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an\n",
      "M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--\n",
      "you know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever\n",
      "see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I\n",
      "don't think--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got\n",
      "up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep\n",
      "instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her\n",
      "going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that\n",
      "they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were\n",
      "trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she\n",
      "picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I\n",
      "ever was at in all my life!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a\n",
      "door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.\n",
      "`But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at once.'\n",
      "And in she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the\n",
      "little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,'\n",
      "she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,\n",
      "and unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went\n",
      "to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it\n",
      "in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down\n",
      "the little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the\n",

      "to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go\n",
      "splashing paint over me like that!'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped\n",
      "like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and\n",
      "feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\n",
      "ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\n",
      "soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were\n",
      "ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\n",
      "in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next\n",
      "came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\n",
      "recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\n",
      "manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",
      "noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\n",
      "King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\n",
      "grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\n",
      "her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember\n",

      "gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a\n",
      "large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered\n",
      "about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly\n",
      "marched off after the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers\n",
      "shouted in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question\n",
      "was evidently meant for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes!' shouted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the\n",
      "procession, wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.\n",
      "She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously\n",
      "into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He\n",
      "looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised\n",
      "himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and\n",
      "whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What for?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.\n",
      "I said \"What for?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a\n",
      "little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a\n",
      "frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came\n",
      "rather late, and the Queen said--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,\n",
      "and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up\n",
      "against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or\n",
      "two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a\n",
      "curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and\n",
      "furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live\n",
      "flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\n",
      "stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her\n",
      "flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,\n",
      "comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,\n",
      "but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened\n",
      "out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it\n",
      "WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a\n",
      "puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\n",
      "and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\n",
      "it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,\n",
      "there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers\n",
      "were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\n",
      "ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very\n",
      "difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,\n",
      "quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in\n",
      "a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went\n",
      "stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with\n",
      "her head!' about once in a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as\n",
      "yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might\n",
      "happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of\n",
      "me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great\n",
      "wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering\n",
      "whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a\n",
      "curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at\n",
      "first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to\n",
      "be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I\n",
      "shall have somebody to talk to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was\n",
      "mouth enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no\n",
      "use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at\n",
      "least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,\n",
      "and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the\n",
      "game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The\n",
      "Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and\n",
      "no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather\n",
      "a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't\n",
      "hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in\n",
      "particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and\n",
      "you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;\n",
      "for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next\n",
      "walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have\n",
      "croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it\n",
      "saw mine coming!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then\n",
      "she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so\n",
      "she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while\n",
      "finishing the game.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and\n",
      "looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me\n",
      "to introduce it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:\n",
      "`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me\n",
      "like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in\n",
      "some book, but I don't remember where.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and\n",
      "he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I\n",
      "wish you would have this cat removed!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great\n",
      "or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking\n",
      "round.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and\n",
      "he hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game\n",
      "was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,\n",
      "screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three\n",
      "of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and\n",
      "she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in\n",
      "such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or\n",
      "not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,\n",
      "which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one\n",
      "of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her\n",
      "flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where\n",
      "Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up\n",
      "into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,\n",
      "the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:\n",
      "`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches\n",
      "are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away\n",
      "under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for\n",
      "a little more conversation with her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to\n",
      "find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute\n",
      "going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who\n",
      "were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,\n",
      "and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to\n",
      "settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,\n",
      "though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed\n",
      "to make out exactly what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a\n",
      "head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had\n",
      "never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin\n",
      "at HIS time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about\n",
      "it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.\n",

      "and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went\n",

      "  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\n",
      "distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\n",
      "as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart\n",
      "would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she\n",
      "asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the\n",
      "same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got\n",

      "finished.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice\n",

      "\n",
      "  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only\n",
      "by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and\n",
      "the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very\n",
      "nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your\n",

      "more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\n",

      "  `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more\n",
      "calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to\n",

      "  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\n",
      "question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and\n",

      "last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!\n",
      "Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:\n",

      "  `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock\n",

      "off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,\n",

her sisteron the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she hadpeeped into the book her sister was reading but it had nopictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a bookthought alice without pictures or conversation so she was considering in her own mind as well as she couldfor the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whetherthe pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the troubleof getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a whiterabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alicethink it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say toitself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thoughtit over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to havewondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite naturalbut when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started toher feet for it flashed across her mind that she had neverbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch totake out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across thefield after it and fortunately was just in time to see it popdown a large rabbithole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it never onceconsidering how in the world she was to get out again the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some wayand then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not amoment to think about stopping herself before she found herselffalling down a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for shehad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and towonder what was going to happen next first she tried to lookdown and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark tosee anything then she looked at the sides of the well andnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelveshere and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs shetook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it waslabelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment itwas empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killingsomebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as shefell past it well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this ishall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyllall think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about iteven if i fell off the top of the house which was very likelytrue down down down would the fall never come to an end iwonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloudi must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth letme see that would be four thousand miles down i think foryou see alice had learnt several things of this sort in herlessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very goodopportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one tolisten to her still it was good practice to say it over yesthats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitudeor longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude wasor longitude either but thought they were nice grand words tosay presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall rightthrough the earth how funny itll seem to come out among thepeople that walk with their heads downward the antipathies ithink she was rather glad there was no one listening thistime as it didnt sound at all the right word but i shallhave to ask them what the name of the country is you knowplease maam is this new zealand or australia and she triedto curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre fallingthrough the air do you think you could manage it and whatan ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itllnever do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soonbegan talking again dinahll miss me very much tonight ishould think dinah was the cat i hope theyll rememberher saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you weredown here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid butyou might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you knowbut do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to getrather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort ofway do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes dobats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer eitherquestion it didnt much matter which way she put it she feltthat she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that shewas walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her veryearnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat abat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap ofsticks and dry leaves and the fall was over alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in amoment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before herwas another long passage and the white rabbit was still insight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lostaway went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear itsay as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how lateits getting she was close behind it when she turned thecorner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she foundherself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lampshanging from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all lockedand when alice had been all the way down one side and up theother trying every door she walked sadly down the middlewondering how she was ever to get out again suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made ofsolid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden keyand alices first thought was that it might belong to one of thedoors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large orthe key was too small but at any rate it would not open any ofthem however on the second time round she came upon a lowcurtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a littledoor about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden keyin the lock and to her great delight it fitted alice opened the door and found that it led into a smallpassage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down andlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever sawhow she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander aboutamong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains butshe could not even get her head through the doorway and even ifmy head would go through thought poor alice it would be ofvery little use without my shoulders oh how i wishi could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i onlyknow how to begin for you see so many outoftheway thingshad happened lately that alice had begun to think that very fewthings indeed were really impossible there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so shewent back to the table half hoping she might find another key onit or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up liketelescopes this time she found a little bottle on it whichcertainly was not here before said alice and round the neckof the bottle was a paper label with the words drink mebeautifully printed on it in large letters it was all very well to say drink me but the wise littlealice was not going to do that in a hurry no ill lookfirst she said and see whether its marked poison or notfor she had read several nice little histories about children whohad got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasantthings all because they would not remember the simple rulestheir friends had taught them such as that a redhot pokerwill burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut yourfinger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she hadnever forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle markedpoison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner orlater however this bottle was not marked poison so alice venturedto taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sortof mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roastturkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finishedit off what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting uplike a telescope and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high andher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the rightsize for going through the little door into that lovely gardenfirst however she waited for a few minutes to see if she wasgoing to shrink any further she felt a little nervous aboutthis for it might end you know said alice to herself in mygoing out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should belike then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle islike after the candle is blown out for she could not rememberever having seen such a thing after a while finding that nothing more happened she decidedon going into the garden at once but alas for poor alicewhen she got to the door she found she had forgotten thelittle golden key and when she went back to the table for itshe found she could not possibly reach it she could see itquite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climbup one of the legs of the table but it was too slipperyand when she had tired herself out with tryingthe poor little thing sat down and cried come theres no use in crying like that said alice toherself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minuteshe generally gave herself very good advice though she veryseldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself soseverely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she rememberedtrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a gameof croquet she was playing against herself for this curiouschild was very fond of pretending to be two people but its nouse now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people whytheres hardly enough of me left to make one respectableperson soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying underthe table she opened it and found in it a very small cake onwhich the words eat me were beautifully marked in currantswell ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow largeri can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creepunder the door so either way ill get into the garden and idont care which happens she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself whichway which way holding her hand on the top of her head tofeel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised tofind that she remained the same size to be sure this generallyhappens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into theway of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happenthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in thecommon way so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake chapter ii the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so muchsurprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak goodenglish now im opening out like the largest telescope thatever was goodbye feet for when she looked down at herfeet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting sofar off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put onyour shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure i shantbe able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myselfabout you you must manage the best way you can but i must bekind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk theway i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair ofboots every christmas and she went on planning to herself how she would manage itthey must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itllseem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd thedirections will look alices right foot esq hearthrug near the fender with alices loveoh dear what nonsense im talking just then her head struck against the roof of the hall infact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once tookup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on oneside to look through into the garden with one eye but to getthrough was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began tocry again you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a greatgirl like you she might well say this to go on crying inthis way stop this moment i tell you but she went on allthe same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large poolall round her about four inches deep and reaching half down thehall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in thedistance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was comingit was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with apair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in theother he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering tohimself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh wont shebe savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so desperatethat she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbitcame near her she began in a low timid voice if you pleasesir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kidgloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hardas he could go alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was veryhot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talkingdear dear how queer everything is today and yesterdaythings went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed inthe night let me think was i the same when i got up thismorning i almost think i can remember feeling a littledifferent but if im not the same the next question is who inthe world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she beganthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same ageas herself to see if she could have been changed for any ofthem im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in suchlong ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and imsure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and sheoh she knows such a very little besides shes she and im iandoh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all thethings i used to know let me see four times five is twelveand four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh deari shall never get to twenty at that rate however themultiplication table doesnt signify lets try geographylondon is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of romeand romeno thats all wrong im certain i must have beenchanged for mabel ill try and say how doth the littleand she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessonsand began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse andstrange and the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws im sure those are not the right words said poor alice andher eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabelafter all and i shall have to go and live in that poky littlehouse and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever somany lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if immabel ill stay down here itll be no use their putting theirheads down and saying come up again dear i shall only lookup and say who am i then tell me that first and then if ilike being that person ill come up if not ill stay downhere till im somebody elsebut oh dear cried alice with asudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their headsdown i am so very tired of being all alone here as she said this she looked down at her hands and wassurprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits littlewhite kid gloves while she was talking how can i have donethat she thought i must be growing small again she got upand went to the table to measure herself by it and found thatas nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet highand was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that thecause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped ithastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogetherthat was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened atthe sudden change but very glad to find herself still inexistence and now for the garden and she ran with all speedback to the little door but alas the little door was shutagain and the little golden key was lying on the glass table asbefore and things are worse than ever thought the poor childfor i never was so small as this before never and i declareits too bad that it is as she said these words her foot slipped and in anothermoment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her firstidea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in thatcase i can go back by railway she said to herself alice hadbeen to the seaside once in her life and had come to the generalconclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you finda number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging inthe sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses andbehind them a railway station however she soon made out thatshe was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was ninefeet high i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam abouttrying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now isuppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queerthing to be sure however everything is queer today just then she heard something splashing about in the pool alittle way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was atfirst she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but thenshe remembered how small she was now and she soon made out thatit was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to thismouse everything is so outoftheway down here that i shouldthink very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm intrying so she began o mouse do you know the way out ofthis pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mousealice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouseshe had never done such a thing before but she remembered havingseen in her brothers latin grammar a mouseof a mouseto amousea mouseo mouse the mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its littleeyes but it said nothing perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice idaresay its a french mouse come over with william theconqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice hadno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so shebegan again ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence inher french lessonbook the mouse gave a sudden leap out of thewater and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i begyour pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt thepoor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionatevoice would you like cats if you were me well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont beangry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinahi think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see hershe is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herselfas she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring sonicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceandshe is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capitalone for catching miceoh i beg your pardon cried alice againfor this time the mouse was bristling all over and she feltcertain it must be really offended we wont talk about her anymore if youd rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the endof his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our familyalways hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hearthe name again i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change thesubject of conversation are youare you fondofof dogsthe mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there issuch a nice little dog near our house i should like to show youa little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curlybrown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them anditll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsicant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer youknow and he says its so useful its worth a hundred poundshe says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried alice in asorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again for themouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go andmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went so she called softly after it mouse dear do come backagain and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dontlike them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swamslowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alicethought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get tothe shore and then ill tell you my history and youllunderstand why it is i hate cats and dogs it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowdedwith the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were aduck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curiouscreatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to theshore chapter iii a caucusrace and a long tale they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on thebankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with theirfur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross anduncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry again theyhad a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemedquite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly withthem as if she had known them all her life indeed she hadquite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulkyand would only say i am older than you and must know betterand this alice would not allow without knowing how old it wasand as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was nomore to be said at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority amongthem called out sit down all of you and listen to me illsoon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a largering with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyesanxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a badcold if she did not get dry very soon ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all readythis is the driest thing i know silence all round if you pleasewilliam the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope wassoon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had beenof late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin andmorcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh said the lory with a shiver i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but verypolitely did you speak not i said the lory hastily i thought you did said the mouse i proceed edwin andmorcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for himand even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury foundit advisable found what said the duck found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course youknow what it means i know what it means well enough when i find a thing saidthe duck its generally a frog or a worm the question iswhat did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went onfound it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet williamand offer him the crown williams conduct at first wasmoderate but the insolence of his normans how are yougetting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as itspoke as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesntseem to dry me at all in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet imove that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of moreenergetic remedies speak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning ofhalf those long words and whats more i dont believe you doeither and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smilesome of the other birds tittered audibly what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tonewas that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace what is a caucusrace said alice not that she wanted muchto know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebodyought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do itand as you might like to try the thing yourself some winterday i will tell you how the dodo managed it first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle theexact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the partywere placed along the course here and there there was no onetwo three and away but they began running when they likedand left off when they liked so that it was not easy to knowwhen the race was over however when they had been running halfan hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly calledout the race is over and they all crowded round it pantingand asking but who has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal ofthought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed uponits forehead the position in which you usually see shakespearein the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence atlast the dodo said everybody has won and all must haveprizes but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voicesasked why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice withone finger and the whole party at once crowded round hercalling out in a confused way prizes prizes alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her handin her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the saltwater had not got into it and handed them round as prizesthere was exactly one apiece all round but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse of course the dodo replied very gravely what else haveyou got in your pocket he went on turning to alice only a thimble said alice sadly hand it over here said the dodo then they all crowded round her once more while the dodosolemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance ofthis elegant thimble and when it had finished this shortspeech they all cheered alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all lookedso grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could notthink of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimblelooking as solemn as she could the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noiseand confusion as the large birds complained that they could nottaste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted onthe back however it was over at last and they sat down againin a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more you promised to tell me your history you know said aliceand why it is you hatec and d she added in a whisper halfafraid that it would be offended again mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning toalice and sighing it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down withwonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad andshe kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking sothat her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you come ill take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning ive nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath ill be judge ill be jury said cunning old fury ill try the whole cause and condemn you to death you are not attending said the mouse to alice severelywhat are you thinking of i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got tothe fifth bend i think i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful andlooking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting upand walking away you insult me by talking such nonsense i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easilyoffended you know the mouse only growled in reply please come back and finish your story alice called afterit and the others all joined in chorus yes please do butthe mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a littlequicker what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon as itwas quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity ofsaying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to younever to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said theyoung crab a little snappishly youre enough to try thepatience of an oyster i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloudaddressing nobody in particular shed soon fetch it back and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the questionsaid the lory alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk abouther pet dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one forcatching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see herafter the birds why shell eat a little bird as soon as lookat it this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the partysome of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie beganwrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must begetting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat and a canarycalled out in a trembling voice to its children come away mydears its high time you were all in bed on various pretextsthey all moved off and alice was soon left alone i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in amelancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here and imsure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah iwonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alicebegan to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspiritedin a little while however she again heard a little pattering offootsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hopingthat the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back tofinish his story chapter iv the rabbit sends in a little bill it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again andlooking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost somethingand she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchessoh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers shell get meexecuted as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i havedropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it waslooking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and shevery goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they werenowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since herswim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table andthe little door had vanished completely very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting aboutand called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what areyou doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair ofgloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightenedthat she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to withouttrying to explain the mistake it had made he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ranhow surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but idbetter take him his fan and glovesthat is if i can find themas she said this she came upon a neat little house on the doorof which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbitengraved upon it she went in without knocking and hurriedupstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary annand be turned out of the house before she had found the fan andgloves how queer it seems alice said to herself to be goingmessages for a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me onmessages next and she began fancying the sort of thing thatwould happen miss alice come here directly and get readyfor your walk coming in a minute nurse but ive got to seethat the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice wenton that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began orderingpeople about like that by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room witha table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and twoor three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan anda pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room whenher eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass there was no label this time with the words drink mebut nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i knowsomething interesting is sure to happen she said to herselfwhenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what thisbottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again forreally im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expectedbefore she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressingagainst the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from beingbroken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herselfthats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is icant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite somuch alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing andgrowing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor inanother minute there was not even room for this and she triedthe effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and theother arm curled round her head still she went on growing andas a last resource she put one arm out of the window and onefoot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no morewhatever happens what will become of me luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its fulleffect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortableand as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever gettingout of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when onewasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered aboutby mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down thatrabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you knowthis sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to mewhen i used to read fairytales i fancied that kind of thingnever happened and now here i am in the middle of one thereought to be a book written about me that there ought and wheni grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in asorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any morehere but then thought alice shall i never get any older than iam now thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut thenalways to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that oh you foolish alice she answered herself how can youlearn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and noroom at all for any lessonbooks and so she went on taking first one side and then the otherand making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a fewminutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my glovesthis moment then came a little pattering of feet on thestairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her andshe trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that shewas now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had noreason to be afraid of it presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open itbut as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressedhard against it that attempt proved a failure alice heard itsay to itself then ill go round and get in at the window that you wont thought alice and after waiting till shefancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenlyspread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did notget hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a falland a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it wasjust possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or somethingof the sort next came an angry voicethe rabbitspat pat where areyou and then a voice she had never heard before sure thenim here digging for apples yer honour digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily herecome and help me out of this sounds of more broken glass now tell me pat whats that in the window sure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why itfills the whole window sure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that well its got no business there at any rate go and take itaway there was a long silence after this and alice could only hearwhispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yerhonour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and atlast she spread out her hand again and made another snatch inthe air this time there were two little shrieks and moresounds of broken glass what a number of cucumberframes theremust be thought alice i wonder what theyll do next as forpulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure idont want to stay in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more atlast came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of agood many voices all talking together she made out the wordswheres the other ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but onebills got the otherbill fetch it here ladhere put em upat this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach halfhigh enough yetoh theyll do well enough dont be particularhere bill catch hold of this ropewill the roof bearmindthat loose slateoh its coming down heads below a loudcrashnow who did thatit was bill i fancywhos to godown the chimneynay i shant you do itthat i wontthenbills to go downhere bill the master says youre togo down the chimney oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he saidalice to herself shy they seem to put everything upon billi wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace isnarrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could andwaited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of whatsort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney closeabove her then saying to herself this is bill she gave onesharp kick and waited to see what would happen next the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goesbill then the rabbits voice alongcatch him you by thehedge then silence and then another confusion of voicesholdup his headbrandy nowdont choke himhow was it old fellowwhat happened to you tell us all about it last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats billthought alice well i hardly knowno more thank ye imbetter nowbut im a deal too flustered to tell youall i knowis something comes at me like a jackinthebox and up i goeslike a skyrocket so you did old fellow said the others we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice andalice called out as loud as she could if you do ill setdinah at you there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought toherself i wonder what they will do next if they had anysense theyd take the roof off after a minute or two theybegan moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say abarrowful will do to begin with a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long todoubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles camerattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the faceill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted outyoud better not do that again which produced another deadsilence alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were allturning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a brightidea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes shethought its sure to make some change in my size and as itcant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller isuppose so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to findthat she began shrinking directly as soon as she was smallenough to get through the door she ran out of the house andfound quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outsidethe poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up bytwo guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottlethey all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but sheran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in athick wood the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as shewandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size againand the second thing is to find my way into that lovely gardeni think that will be the best plan it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly andsimply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not thesmallest idea how to set about it and while she was peeringabout anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just overher head made her look up in a great hurry an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large roundeyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch herpoor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she triedhard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all thetime at the thought that it might be hungry in which case itwould be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit ofstick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumpedinto the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delightand rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alicedodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being runover and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppymade another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels inits hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was verylike having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting everymoment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistleagain then the puppy began a series of short charges at thestick running a very little way forwards each time and a longway back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it satdown a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of itsmouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escapeso she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and outof breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in thedistance and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as sheleant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herselfwith one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricksvery much ifif id only been the right size to do it ohdear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again letme seehow is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat ordrink something or other but the great question is what the great question certainly was what alice looked all roundher at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not seeanything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink underthe circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near herabout the same height as herself and when she had looked underit and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to herthat she might as well look and see what was on the top of it she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge ofthe mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a largecaterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms foldedquietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest noticeof her or of anything else chapter v advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time insilence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of itsmouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alicereplied rather shyly ii hardly know sir just at presentat least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i thinki must have been changed several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternlyexplain yourself i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice becauseim not myself you see i dont see said the caterpillar im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied verypolitely for i cant understand it myself to begin with andbeing so many different sizes in a day is very confusing it isnt said the caterpillar well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice butwhen you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day youknowand then after that into a butterfly i should think youllfeel it a little queer wont you not a bit said the caterpillar well perhaps your feelings may be different said aliceall i know is it would feel very queer to me you said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of theconversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillarsmaking such very short remarks and she drew herself up and saidvery gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the caterpillar here was another puzzling question and as alice could notthink of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be ina very unpleasant state of mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her ive somethingimportant to say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came backagain keep your temper said the caterpillar is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well asshe could no said the caterpillar alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing elseto do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worthhearing for some minutes it puffed away without speaking butat last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouthagain and said so you think youre changed do you im afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things asi usedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together cant remember what things said the caterpillar well ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but itall came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar alice folded her hands and began you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right in my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that im perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again you are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it in my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever i have answered three questions and that is enough said his father dont give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off or ill kick you down stairs that is not said right said the caterpillar not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of thewords have got altered it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillardecidedly and there was silence for some minutes the caterpillar was the first to speak what size do you want to be it asked oh im not particular as to size alice hastily repliedonly one doesnt like changing so often you know i dont know said the caterpillar alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted inher life before and she felt that she was losing her temper are you content now said the caterpillar well i should like to be a little larger sir if youwouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretchedheight to be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillarangrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly threeinches high but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous toneand she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be soeasily offended youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and itput the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak againin a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of itsmouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it gotdown off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merelyremarking as it went one side will make you grow taller andthe other side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what thought alice toherself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she hadasked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for aminute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and asit was perfectly round she found this a very difficult questionhowever at last she stretched her arms round it as far as theywould go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled alittle of the righthand bit to try the effect the next momentshe felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck herfoot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change butshe felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinkingrapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bither chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there washardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last andmanaged to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit come my heads free at last said alice in a tone ofdelight which changed into alarm in another moment when shefound that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she couldsee when she looked down was an immense length of neck whichseemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that layfar below her what can all that green stuff be said alice and wherehave my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it icant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but noresult seemed to follow except a little shaking among thedistant green leaves as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to herhead she tried to get her head down to them and was delightedto find that her neck would bend about easily in any directionlike a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into agraceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves whichshe found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which shehad been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in ahurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beatingher violently with its wings serpent screamed the pigeon im not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a moresubdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried everyway and nothing seems to suit them i havent the least idea what youre talking about saidalice ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ivetried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her butthose serpents theres no pleasing them alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was nouse in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said thepigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpents night andday why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks im very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who wasbeginning to see its meaning and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continuedthe pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i wasthinking i should be free of them at last they must needs comewriggling down from the sky ugh serpent but im not a serpent i tell you said alice im aima well what are you said the pigeon i can see youretrying to invent something iim a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as sheremembered the number of changes she had gone through that day a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of thedeepest contempt ive seen a good many little girls in mytime but never one with such a neck as that no no youre aserpent and theres no use denying it i suppose youll betelling me next that you never tasted an egg i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a verytruthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much asserpents do you know i dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do whythen theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can say this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silentfor a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity ofadding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough andwhat does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or aserpent it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but imnot looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldntwant yours i dont like them raw well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as itsettled down again into its nest alice crouched down among thetrees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangledamong the branches and every now and then she had to stop anduntwist it after a while she remembered that she still held thepieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work verycarefully nibbling first at one and then at the other andgrowing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she hadsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right sizethat it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in afew minutes and began talking to herself as usual cometheres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changesare im never sure what im going to be from one minute toanother however ive got back to my right size the nextthing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to bedone i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon anopen place with a little house in it about four feet highwhoever lives there thought alice itll never do to comeupon them this size why i should frighten them out of theirwits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and didnot venture to go near the house till she had brought herselfdown to nine inches high chapter vi pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house andwondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery camerunning out of the woodshe considered him to be a footmanbecause he was in livery otherwise judging by his face onlyshe would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the doorwith his knuckles it was opened by another footman in liverywith a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmenalice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over theirheads she felt very curious to know what it was all about andcrept a little way out of the wood to listen the fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a greatletter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over tothe other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess aninvitation from the queen to play croquet the frogfootmanrepeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of thewords a little from the queen an invitation for the duchessto play croquet then they both bowed low and their curls got entangledtogether alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back intothe wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peepedout the fishfootman was gone and the other was sitting on theground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky alice went timidly up to the door and knocked theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman andthat for two reasons first because im on the same side of thedoor as you are secondly because theyre making such a noiseinside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there wasa most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howlingand sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dishor kettle had been broken to pieces please then said alice how am i to get in there might be some sense in your knocking the footman wenton without attending to her if we had the door between us forinstance if you were inside you might knock and i could letyou out you know he was looking up into the sky all the timehe was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil butperhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are sovery nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he mightanswer questionshow am i to get in she repeated aloud i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow at this moment the door of the house opened and a large platecame skimming out straight at the footmans head it justgrazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the treesbehind him or next day maybe the footman continued in the same toneexactly as if nothing had happened how am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone are you to get in at all said the footman thats thefirst question you know it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told soits really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all thecreatures argue its enough to drive one crazy the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity forrepeating his remark with variations i shall sit here hesaid on and off for days and days but what am i to do said alice anything you like said the footman and began whistling oh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperatelyhes perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in the door led right into a large kitchen which was full ofsmoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on athreelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook wasleaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed tobe full of soup theres certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said toherself as well as she could for sneezing there was certainly too much of it in the air even theduchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it wassneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause theonly things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cookand a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning fromear to ear please would you tell me said alice a little timidly forshe was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her tospeak first why your cat grins like that its a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why pig she said the last word with such sudden violence that alicequite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressedto the baby and not to her so she took courage and went onagain i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact ididnt know that cats could grin they all can said the duchess and most of em do i dont know of any that do alice said very politelyfeeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thoughtit would be as well to introduce some other subject ofconversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook tookthe cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to workthrowing everything within her reach at the duchess and the babythe fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepansplates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even whenthey hit her and the baby was howling so much already that itwas quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping upand down in an agony of terror oh there goes his preciousnose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and verynearly carried it off if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in ahoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than itdoes which would not be an advantage said alice who felt veryglad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of herknowledge just think of what work it would make with the dayand night you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turnround on its axis talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meantto take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup andseemed not to be listening so she went on again twentyfourhours i think or is it twelve i oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abidefigures and with that she began nursing her child againsinging a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it aviolent shake at the end of every line speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases chorus in which the cook and the baby joined wow wow wow while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kepttossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thinghowled so that alice could hardly hear the words i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases chorus wow wow wow here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess saidto alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go andget ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out ofthe room the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went outbut it just missed her alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in alldirections just like a starfish thought alice the poorlittle thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught itand kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out againso that altogether for the first minute or two it was as muchas she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing itwhich was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keeptight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent itsundoing itself she carried it out into the open air if idont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sureto kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave itbehind she said the last words out loud and the little thinggrunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dontgrunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressingyourself the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously intoits face to see what was the matter with it there could be nodoubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snoutthan a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small fora baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing atall but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and lookedinto its eyes again to see if there were any tears no there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pigmy dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to dowith you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again orgrunted it was impossible to say which and they went on forsome while in silence alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am ito do with this creature when i get it home when it gruntedagain so violently that she looked down into its face in somealarm this time there could be no mistake about it it wasneither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would bequite absurd for her to carry it further so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved tosee it trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown upshe said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly childbut it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she beganthinking over other children she knew who might do very well aspigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the rightway to change them when she was a little startled by seeingthe cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off the cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked goodnatured she thought still it had very long claws and a greatmany teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not atall know whether it would like the name however it onlygrinned a little wider come its pleased so far thoughtalice and she went on would you tell me please which way iought to go from here that depends a good deal on where you want to get to saidthe cat i dont much care where said alice then it doesnt matter which way you go said the cat so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation oh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walklong enough alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried anotherquestion what sort of people live about here in that direction the cat said waving its right paw roundlives a hatter and in that direction waving the other pawlives a march hare visit either you like theyre both mad but i dont want to go among mad people alice remarked oh you cant help that said the cat were all mad hereim mad youre mad how do you know im mad said alice you must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come here alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went onand how do you know that youre mad to begin with said the cat a dogs not mad you grantthat i suppose so said alice well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when itsangry and wags its tail when its pleased now i growl when impleased and wag my tail when im angry therefore im mad i call it purring not growling said alice call it what you like said the cat do you play croquetwith the queen today i should like it very much said alice but i havent beeninvited yet youll see me there said the cat and vanished alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so usedto queer things happening while she was looking at the placewhere it had been it suddenly appeared again bythebye what became of the baby said the cat idnearly forgotten to ask it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it hadcome back in a natural way i thought it would said the cat and vanished again alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but itdid not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in thedirection in which the march hare was said to live ive seenhatters before she said to herself the march hare will bemuch the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont beraving madat least not so mad as it was in march as she saidthis she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on abranch of a tree did you say pig or fig said the cat i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keepappearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowlybeginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grinwhich remained some time after the rest of it had gone well ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alicebut a grin without a cat its the most curious thing i eversaw in my life she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of thehouse of the march hare she thought it must be the right housebecause the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof wasthatched with fur it was so large a house that she did notlike to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthandbit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high eventhen she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herselfsuppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish idgone to see the hatter instead chapter vii a mad teaparty there was a table set out under a tree in front of the houseand the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it adormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other twowere using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talkingover its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought aliceonly as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind the table was a large one but the three were all crowdedtogether at one corner of it no room no room they criedout when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room saidalice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at oneend of the table have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on itbut tea i dont see any wine she remarked there isnt any said the march hare then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said aliceangrily it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without beinginvited said the march hare i didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for agreat many more than three your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had beenlooking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this washis first speech you should learn not to make personal remarks alice saidwith some severity its very rude the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but allhe said was why is a raven like a writingdesk come we shall have some fun now thought alice im gladtheyve begun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that sheadded aloud do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to itsaid the march hare exactly so said alice then you should say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at leastat least i mean whati saythats the same thing you know not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might justas well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eatwhat i see you might just as well say added the march hare that ilike what i get is the same thing as i get what i like you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed tobe talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is thesame thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here theconversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minutewhile alice thought over all she could remember about ravens andwritingdesks which wasnt much the hatter was the first to break the silence what day ofthe month is it he said turning to alice he had taken hiswatch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shakingit every now and then and holding it to his ear alice considered a little and then said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butterwouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the marchhare it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hattergrumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily thenhe dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but hecould think of nothing better to say than his first remark itwas the best butter you know alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiositywhat a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of themonth and doesnt tell what oclock it is why should it muttered the hatter does your watch tellyou what year it is of course not alice replied very readily but thatsbecause it stays the same year for such a long time together which is just the case with mine said the hatter alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatters remark seemed tohave no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly englishi dont quite understand you she said as politely as shecould the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poureda little hot tea upon its nose the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said withoutopening its eyes of course of course just what i was going toremark myself have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning toalice again no i give it up alice replied whats the answer i havent the slightest idea said the hatter nor i said the march hare alice sighed wearily i think you might do something betterwith the time she said than waste it in asking riddles thathave no answers if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter youwouldnt talk about wasting it its him i dont know what you mean said alice of course you dont the hatter said tossing his headcontemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to time perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have tobeat time when i learn music ah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont standbeating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed doalmost anything you liked with the clock for instance supposeit were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessonsyoud only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes theclock in a twinkling halfpast one time for dinner i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in awhisper that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfullybut theni shouldnt be hungry for it you know not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keepit to halfpast one as long as you liked is that the way you manage alice asked the hatter shook his head mournfully not i he repliedwe quarrelled last marchjust before he went mad you knowpointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at thegreat concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing twinkle twinkle little bat how i wonder what youre atyou know the song perhaps ive heard something like it said alice it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way up above the world you fly like a teatray in the sky twinkle twinklehere the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleeptwinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long thatthey had to pinch it to make it stop well id hardly finished the first verse said the hatterwhen the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering thetime off with his head how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tonehe wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now a bright idea came into alices head is that the reason somany teathings are put out here she asked yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its alwaysteatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles then you keep moving round i suppose said alice exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up but what happens when you come to the beginning again aliceventured to ask suppose we change the subject the march hare interruptedyawning im getting tired of this i vote the young ladytells us a story im afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed atthe proposal then the dormouse shall they both cried wake updormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once the dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasnt asleep hesaid in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellowswere saying tell us a story said the march hare yes please do pleaded alice and be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleepagain before its done once upon a time there were three little sisters thedormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsielacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well what did they live on said alice who always took a greatinterest in questions of eating and drinking they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking aminute or two they couldnt have done that you know alice gentlyremarked theyd have been ill so they were said the dormouse very ill alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary waysof living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she wenton but why did they live at the bottom of a well take some more tea the march hare said to alice veryearnestly ive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone soi cant take more you mean you cant take less said the hatter its veryeasy to take more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice whos making personal remarks now the hatter askedtriumphantly alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helpedherself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to thedormouse and repeated her question why did they live at thebottom of a well the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it andthen said it was a treaclewell theres no such thing alice was beginning very angrily butthe hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormousesulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish thestory for yourself no please go on alice said very humbly i wont interruptagain i dare say there may be one one indeed said the dormouse indignantly however heconsented to go on and so these three little sisterstheywere learning to draw you know what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise treacle said the dormouse without considering at all thistime i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter lets all moveone place on he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him themarch hare moved into the dormouses place and alice ratherunwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was theonly one who got any advantage from the change and alice was agood deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upsetthe milkjug into his plate alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she beganvery cautiously but i dont understand where did they drawthe treacle from you can draw water out of a waterwell said the hatter soi should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewellehstupid but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse notchoosing to notice this last remark of course they were said the dormouse well in this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormousego on for some time without interrupting it they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning andrubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drewall manner of thingseverything that begins with an m why with an m said alice why not said the march hare alice was silent the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was goingoff into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke upagain with a little shriek and went on that begins with anm such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessyou know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you eversee such a thing as a drawing of a muchness really now you ask me said alice very much confused idont think then you shouldnt talk said the hatter this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she gotup in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleepinstantly and neither of the others took the least notice of hergoing though she looked back once or twice half hoping thatthey would call after her the last time she saw them they weretrying to put the dormouse into the teapot at any rate ill never go there again said alice as shepicked her way through the wood its the stupidest teaparty iever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had adoor leading right into it thats very curious she thoughtbut everythings curious today i think i may as well go in at onceand in she went once more she found herself in the long hall and close to thelittle glass table now ill manage better this timeshe said to herself and began by taking the little golden keyand unlocking the door that led into the garden then she wentto work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of itin her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked downthe little passage and thenshe found herself at last in thebeautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains chapter viii the queens croquetground a large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden theroses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners atit busily painting them red alice thought this a very curiousthing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came upto them she heard one of them say look out now five dont gosplashing paint over me like that i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven joggedmy elbow on which seven looked up and said thats right five alwayslay the blame on others youd better not talk said five i heard the queen say onlyyesterday you deserved to be beheaded what for said the one who had spoken first thats none of your business two said seven yes it is his business said five and ill tell himitwas for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of allthe unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice asshe stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly theothers looked round also and all of them bowed low would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you arepainting those roses five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in alow voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought tohave been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistakeand if the queen was to find it out we should all have our headscut off you know so you see miss were doing our best aforeshe comes to at this moment five who had been anxiouslylooking across the garden called out the queen the queenand the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upontheir faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alicelooked round eager to see the queen first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shapedlike the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands andfeet at the corners next the ten courtiers these wereornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as thesoldiers did after these came the royal children there wereten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along handin hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts nextcame the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alicerecognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervousmanner smiling at everything that was said and went by withoutnoticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying thekings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all thisgrand procession came the king and queen of hearts alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down onher face like the three gardeners but she could not rememberever having heard of such a rule at processions and besideswhat would be the use of a procession thought she if peoplehad all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see itso she stood still where she was and waited when the procession came opposite to alice they all stoppedand looked at her and the queen said severely who is thisshe said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently andturning to alice she went on whats your name child my name is alice so please your majesty said alice verypolitely but she added to herself why theyre only a pack ofcards after all i neednt be afraid of them and who are these said the queen pointing to the threegardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see asthey were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backswas the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whetherthey were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of herown children how should i know said alice surprised at her own courageits no business of mine the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at herfor a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her headoff nonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and thequeen was silent the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly saidconsider my dear she is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knaveturn them over the knave did so very carefully with one foot get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and thethree gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to theking the queen the royal children and everybody else leave off that screamed the queen you make me giddyand then turning to the rosetree she went on what have youbeen doing here may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tonegoing down on one knee as he spoke we were trying i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining theroses off with their heads and the procession moved onthree of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunategardeners who ran to alice for protection you shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into alarge flowerpot that stood near the three soldiers wanderedabout for a minute or two looking for them and then quietlymarched off after the others are their heads off shouted the queen their heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiersshouted in reply thats right shouted the queen can you play croquet the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the questionwas evidently meant for her yes shouted alice come on then roared the queen and alice joined theprocession wondering very much what would happen next itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her sideshe was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiouslyinto her face very said alice wheres the duchess hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone helooked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raisedhimself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear andwhispered shes under sentence of execution what for said alice did you say what a pity the rabbit asked no i didnt said alice i dont think its at all a pityi said what for she boxed the queens ears the rabbit began alice gave alittle scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in afrightened tone the queen will hear you you see she camerather late and the queen said get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunderand people began running about in all directions tumbling upagainst each other however they got settled down in a minute ortwo and the game began alice thought she had never seen such acurious croquetground in her life it was all ridges andfurrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets liveflamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and tostand on their hands and feet to make the arches the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing herflamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked awaycomfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging downbut generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightenedout and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head itwould twist itself round and look up in her face with such apuzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughingand when she had got its head down and was going to begin againit was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolleditself and was in the act of crawling away besides all thisthere was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever shewanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldierswere always getting up and walking off to other parts of theground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a verydifficult game indeed the players all played at once without waiting for turnsquarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and ina very short time the queen was in a furious passion and wentstamping about and shouting off with his head or off withher head about once in a minute alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not asyet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it mighthappen any minute and then thought she what would become ofme theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the greatwonder is that theres any one left alive she was looking about for some way of escape and wonderingwhether she could get away without being seen when she noticed acurious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much atfirst but after watching it a minute or two she made it out tobe a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now ishall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there wasmouth enough for it to speak with alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its nouse speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or atleast one of them in another minute the whole head appearedand then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of thegame feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her thecat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight andno more of it appeared i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rathera complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one canthear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules inparticular at least if there are nobody attends to themandyouve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alivefor instance theres the arch ive got to go through nextwalking about at the other end of the groundand i should havecroqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when itsaw mine coming how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice not at all said alice shes so extremely just thenshe noticed that the queen was close behind her listening soshe went on likely to win that its hardly worth whilefinishing the game the queen smiled and passed on who are you talking to said the king going up to alice andlooking at the cats head with great curiosity its a friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow meto introduce it i dont like the look of it at all said the kinghowever it may kiss my hand if it likes id rather not the cat remarked dont be impertinent said the king and dont look at melike that he got behind alice as he spoke a cat may look at a king said alice ive read that insome book but i dont remember where well it must be removed said the king very decidedly andhe called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear iwish you would have this cat removed the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties greator small off with his head she said without even lookinground ill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly andhe hurried off alice thought she might as well go back and see how the gamewas going on as she heard the queens voice in the distancescreaming with passion she had already heard her sentence threeof the players to be executed for having missed their turns andshe did not like the look of things at all as the game was insuch confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn ornot so she went in search of her hedgehog the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehogwhich seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting oneof them with the other the only difficulty was that herflamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden wherealice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly upinto a tree by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it backthe fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sightbut it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the archesare gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it awayunder her arm that it might not escape again and went back fora little more conversation with her friend when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised tofind quite a large crowd collected round it there was a disputegoing on between the executioner the king and the queen whowere all talking at once while all the rest were quite silentand looked very uncomfortable the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three tosettle the question and they repeated their arguments to herthough as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeedto make out exactly what they said the executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off ahead unless there was a body to cut it off from that he hadnever had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to beginat his time of life the kings argument was that anything that had a head could bebeheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense the queens argument was that if something wasnt done aboutit in less than no time shed have everybody executed all roundit was this last remark that had made the whole party look sograve and anxious alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to theduchess youd better ask her about it shes in prison the queen said to the executioner fetchher here and the executioner went off like an arrow the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone andby the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirelydisappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and downlooking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game chapter ix the mock turtles story you cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear oldthing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionatelyinto alices and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper andthought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that hadmade her so savage when they met in the kitchen when im a duchess she said to herself not in a veryhopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen atall soup does very well withoutmaybe its always pepper thatmakes people hottempered she went on very much pleased athaving found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes themsourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugarand such things that make children sweettempered i only wishpeople knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it youknow she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was alittle startled when she heard her voice close to her earyoure thinking about something my dear and that makes youforget to talk i cant tell you just now what the moral of thatis but i shall remember it in a bit perhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remark tut tut child said the duchess everythings got amoral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself upcloser to alices side as she spoke alice did not much like keeping so close to her firstbecause the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she wasexactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulderand it was an uncomfortably sharp chin however she did notlike to be rude so she bore it as well as she could the games going on rather better now she said by way ofkeeping up the conversation a little tis so said the duchess and the moral of that isohtis love tis love that makes the world go round somebody said alice whispered that its done by everybodyminding their own business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchessdigging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she addedand the moral of that istake care of the sense and thesounds will take care of themselves how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought toherself i dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round yourwaist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that imdoubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try theexperiment he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at allanxious to have the experiment tried very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard bothbite and the moral of that isbirds of a feather flocktogether only mustard isnt a bird alice remarked right as usual said the duchess what a clear way youhave of putting things its a mineral i think said alice of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agreeto everything that alice said theres a large mustardmine nearhere and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine theless there is of yours oh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to thislast remark its a vegetable it doesnt look like one but itis i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral ofthat isbe what you would seem to beor if youd like it putmore simplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise thanwhat it might appear to others that what you were or might havebeen was not otherwise than what you had been would have appearedto them to be otherwise i think i should understand that better alice said verypolitely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow itas you say it thats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchessreplied in a pleased tone pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than thatsaid alice oh dont talk about trouble said the duchess i make youa present of everything ive said as yet a cheap sort of present thought alice im glad they dontgive birthday presents like that but she did not venture tosay it out loud thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of hersharp little chin ive a right to think said alice sharply for she wasbeginning to feel a little worried just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to flyand the m but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice diedaway even in the middle of her favourite word moral and thearm that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked upand there stood the queen in front of them with her arms foldedfrowning like a thunderstorm a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weakvoice now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping onthe ground as she spoke either you or your head must be offand that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment lets go on with the game the queen said to alice and alicewas too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed herback to the croquetground the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absenceand were resting in the shade however the moment they saw herthey hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that amoments delay would cost them their lives all the time they were playing the queen never left offquarrelling with the other players and shouting off with hishead or off with her head those whom she sentenced weretaken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leaveoff being arches to do this so that by the end of half an houror so there were no arches left and all the players except theking the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence ofexecution then the queen left off quite out of breath and said toalice have you seen the mock turtle yet no said alice i dont even know what a mock turtle is its the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen i never saw one or heard of one said alice come on then said the queen and he shall tell you hishistory as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a lowvoice to the company generally you are all pardoned comethats a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quiteunhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in thesun if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the pictureup lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady tosee the mock turtle and to hear his history i must go back andsee after some executions i have ordered and she walked offleaving alice alone with the gryphon alice did not quite likethe look of the creature but on the whole she thought it wouldbe quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savagequeen so she waited the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched thequeen till she was out of sight then it chuckled what funsaid the gryphon half to itself half to alice what is the fun said alice why she said the gryphon its all her fancy that theynever executes nobody you know come on everybody says come on here thought alice as she wentslowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my lifenever they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in thedistance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock andas they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heartwould break she pitied him deeply what is his sorrow sheasked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in thesame words as before its all his fancy that he hasnt gotno sorrow you know come on so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them withlarge eyes full of tears but said nothing this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for toknow your history she do ill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollowtone sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ivefinished so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes alicethought to herself i dont see how he can even finish if hedoesnt begin but she waited patiently once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i wasa real turtle these words were followed by a very long silence broken onlyby an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon andthe constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was verynearly getting up and saying thank you sir for yourinteresting story but she could not help thinking there must bemore to come so she sat still and said nothing when we were little the mock turtle went on at last morecalmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went toschool in the sea the master was an old turtlewe used to callhim tortoise why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one alice asked we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mockturtle angrily really you are very dull you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simplequestion added the gryphon and then they both sat silent andlooked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth atlast the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellowdont be all day about it and he went on in these words yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believeit i never said i didnt interrupted alice you did said the mock turtle hold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speakagain the mock turtle went on we had the best of educationsin fact we went to schoolevery day ive been to a dayschool too said alice you neednt beso proud as all that with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously yes said alice we learned french and music and washing said the mock turtle certainly not said alice indignantly ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the mockturtle in a tone of great relief now at ours they had at theend of the bill french music and washingextra you couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at thebottom of the sea i couldnt afford to learn it said the mock turtle with asigh i only took the regular course what was that inquired alice reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mockturtle replied and then the different branches of arithmeticambition distraction uglification and derision i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say what is it the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise what neverheard of uglifying it exclaimed you know what to beautify isi suppose yes said alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettier well then the gryphon went on if you dont know what touglify is you are a simpleton alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions aboutit so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had youto learn well there was mystery the mock turtle replied countingoff the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modernwith seaography then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an oldcongereel that used to come once a week he taught usdrawling stretching and fainting in coils what was that like said alice well i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said imtoo stiff and the gryphon never learnt it hadnt time said the gryphon i went to the classicsmaster though he was an old crab he was i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh hetaught laughing and grief they used to say so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turnand both creatures hid their faces in their paws and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in ahurry to change the subject ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine thenext and so on what a curious plan exclaimed alice thats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphonremarked because they lessen from day to day this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over alittle before she made her next remark then the eleventh daymust have been a holiday of course it was said the mock turtle and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly thats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in avery decided tone tell her something about the games now chapter x the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapperacross his eyes he looked at alice and tried to speak but fora minute or two sobs choked his voice same as if he had a bonein his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking himand punching him in the back at last the mock turtle recoveredhis voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went onagain you may not have lived much under the sea i havent said aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobsteralice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastilyand said no never so you can have no idea what a delightfulthing a lobster quadrille is no indeed said alice what sort of a dance is it why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the seashore two lines cried the mock turtle seals turtles salmon and so onthen when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon you advance twice each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon of course the mock turtle said advance twice set topartners change lobsters and retire in same order continued thegryphon then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the the lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air as far out to sea as you can swim after them screamed the gryphon turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtlecapering wildly about change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice back to land again and thats all the first figure said themock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatureswho had been jumping about like mad things all this time satdown again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle very much indeed said alice come lets try the first figure said the mock turtle to thegryphon we can do without lobsters you know which shallsing oh you sing said the gryphon ive forgotten the words so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every nowand then treading on her toes when they passed too close andwaving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtlesang this very slowly and sadlywill you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snailtheres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tailsee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advancethey are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join thedancewill you wont you will you wont you will you join thedancewill you wont you will you wont you wont you join thedanceyou can really have no notion how delightful it will bewhen they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to seabut the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askancesaid he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance would not could not would not could not would not join the dance would not could not would not could not could not join the dancewhat matters it how far we go his scaly friend repliedthere is another shore you know upon the other sidethe further off from england the nearer is to francethen turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance thank you its a very interesting dance to watch saidalice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do solike that curious song about the whiting oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle theyyouveseen them of course yes said alice ive often seen them at dinn shechecked herself hastily i dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle butif youve seen them so often of course you know what theyrelike i believe so alice replied thoughtfully they have theirtails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtlecrumbs would all wash off in the sea but they have their tailsin their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtleyawned and shut his eyestell her about the reason and allthat he said to the gryphon the reason is said the gryphon that they would go withthe lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea sothey had to fall a long way so they got their tails fast intheir mouths so they couldnt get them out again thats all thank you said alice its very interesting i never knewso much about a whiting before i can tell you more than that if you like said thegryphon do you know why its called a whiting i never thought about it said alice why it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied verysolemnly alice was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and shoes sherepeated in a wondering tone why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon imean what makes them so shiny alice looked down at them and considered a little before shegave her answer theyre done with blacking i believe boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deepvoice are done with a whiting now you know and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of greatcuriosity soles and eels of course the gryphon replied ratherimpatiently any shrimp could have told you that if id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts werestill running on the song id have said to the porpoise keepback please we dont want you with us they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtlesaid no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise wouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surprise of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish cameto me and told me he was going a journey i should say withwhat porpoise dont you mean purpose said alice i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offendedtone and the gryphon added come lets hear some of youradventures i could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morningsaid alice a little timidly but its no use going back toyesterday because i was a different person then explain all that said the mock turtle no no the adventures first said the gryphon in animpatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time so alice began telling them her adventures from the time whenshe first saw the white rabbit she was a little nervous aboutit just at first the two creatures got so close to her one oneach side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but shegained courage as she went on her listeners were perfectlyquiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are oldfather william to the caterpillar and the words all comingdifferent and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and saidthats very curious its all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon it all came different the mock turtle repeatedthoughtfully i should like to hear her try and repeatsomething now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon asif he thought it had some kind of authority over alice stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard saidthe gryphon how the creatures order one about and make one repeatlessons thought alice i might as well be at school at oncehowever she got up and began to repeat it but her head was sofull of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she wassaying and the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound thats different from what i used to say when i was a childsaid the gryphon well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but itsounds uncommon nonsense alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in herhands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural wayagain i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle she cant explain it said the gryphon hastily go on withthe next verse but about his toes the mock turtle persisted how couldhe turn them out with his nose you know its the first position in dancing alice said but wasdreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change thesubject go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatientlyit begins i passed by his garden alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it wouldall come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie later editions continued as follows the panther took piecrust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtleinterrupted if you dont explain it as you go on its by farthe most confusing thing i ever heard yes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon andalice was only too glad to do so shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille thegryphon went on or would you like the mock turtle to sing youa song oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kindalice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a ratheroffended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing herturtle soup will you old fellow the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimeschoked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening beautiful soup soup of the evening beautiful soup beauootiful soooop beauootiful soooop soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup beautiful soup who cares for fish game or any other dish who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful soup pennyworth only of beautiful soup beauootiful soooop beauootiful soooop soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup chorus again cried the gryphon and the mock turtle hadjust begun to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginningwas heard in the distance come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the handit hurried off without waiting for the end of the song what trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphononly answered come on and ran the faster while more and morefaintly came carried on the breeze that followed them themelancholy words soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup chapter xi who stole the tarts the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne whenthey arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sortsof little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cardsthe knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier oneach side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbitwith a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in theother in the very middle of the court was a table with a largedish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alicequite hungry to look at themi wish theyd get the trial doneshe thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemedto be no chance of this so she began looking at everything abouther to pass away the time alice had never been in a court of justice before but she hadread about them in books and she was quite pleased to find thatshe knew the name of nearly everything there thats thejudge she said to herself because of his great wig the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crownover the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how hedid it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainlynot becoming and thats the jurybox thought alice and those twelvecreatures she was obliged to say creatures you see becausesome of them were animals and some were birds i suppose theyare the jurors she said this last word two or three times overto herself being rather proud of it for she thought andrightly too that very few little girls of her age knew themeaning of it at all however jurymen would have done justas well the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slateswhat are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon theycant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun theyre putting down their names the gryphon whispered inreply for fear they should forget them before the end of thetrial stupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice butshe stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence inthe court and the king put on his spectacles and lookedanxiously round to make out who was talking alice could see as well as if she were looking over theirshoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid thingson their slates and she could even make out that one of themdidnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask hisneighbour to tell him a nice muddle their slatesll be inbefore the trials over thought alice one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked this of coursealice could not stand and she went round the court and gotbehind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking itaway she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it wasbill the lizard could not make out at all what had become ofit so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to writewith one finger for the rest of the day and this was of verylittle use as it left no mark on the slate herald read the accusation said the king on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet andthen unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away consider your verdict the king said to the jury not yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted theresa great deal to come before that call the first witness said the king and the white rabbitblew three blasts on the trumpet and called out firstwitness the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup inone hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other i begpardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but ihadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for you ought to have finished said the king when did youbegin the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him intothe court arminarm with the dormouse fourteenth of march ithink it was he said fifteenth said the march hare sixteenth added the dormouse write that down the king said to the jury and the juryeagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and thenadded them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence take off your hat the king said to the hatter it isnt mine said the hatter stolen the king exclaimed turning to the jury whoinstantly made a memorandum of the fact i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanationive none of my own im a hatter here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at thehatter who turned pale and fidgeted give your evidence said the king and dont be nervous orill have you executed on the spot this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he keptshifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at thequeen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of histeacup instead of the breadandbutter just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation whichpuzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she wasbeginning to grow larger again and she thought at first shewould get up and leave the court but on second thoughts shedecided to remain where she was as long as there was room forher i wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who wassitting next to her i can hardly breathe i cant help it said alice very meekly im growing youve no right to grow here said the dormouse dont talk nonsense said alice more boldly you knowyoure growing too yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormousenot in that ridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkilyand crossed over to the other side of the court all this time the queen had never left off staring at thehatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said toone of the officers of the court bring me the list of thesingers in the last concert on which the wretched hattertrembled so that he shook both his shoes off give your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill haveyou executed whether youre nervous or not im a poor man your majesty the hatter began in atrembling voice and i hadnt begun my teanot above a weekor soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinandthe twinkling of the tea the twinkling of the what said the king it began with the tea the hatter replied of course twinkling begins with a t said the king sharplydo you take me for a dunce go on im a poor man the hatter went on and most thingstwinkled after thatonly the march hare said i didnt the march hare interrupted in a great hurry you did said the hatter i deny it said the march hare he denies it said the king leave out that part well at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went onlooking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but thedormouse denied nothing being fast asleep after that continued the hatter i cut some more breadandbutter but what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked that i cant remember said the hatter you must remember remarked the king or ill have youexecuted the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutterand went down on one knee im a poor man your majesty hebegan youre a very poor speaker said the king here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediatelysuppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather ahard word i will just explain to you how it was done they hada large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with stringsinto this they slipped the guineapig head first and then satupon it im glad ive seen that done thought alice ive so oftenread in the newspapers at the end of trials there was someattempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by theofficers of the court and i never understood what it meanttill now if thats all you know about it you may stand downcontinued the king i cant go no lower said the hatter im on the floor asit is then you may sit down the king replied here the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed come that finished the guineapigs thought alice now weshall get on better id rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxiouslook at the queen who was reading the list of singers you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left thecourt without even waiting to put his shoes on and just take his head off outside the queen added to oneof the officers but the hatter was out of sight before theofficer could get to the door call the next witness said the king the next witness was the duchesss cook she carried thepepperbox in her hand and alice guessed who it was even beforeshe got into the court by the way the people near the door begansneezing all at once give your evidence said the king shant said the cook the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in alow voice your majesty must crossexamine this witness well if i must i must the king said with a melancholyair and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook tillhis eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice whatare tarts made of pepper mostly said the cook treacle said a sleepy voice behind her collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out behead thatdormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinchhim off with his whiskers for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting thedormouse turned out and by the time they had settled downagain the cook had disappeared never mind said the king with an air of great reliefcall the next witness and he added in an undertone to thequeen really my dear you must crossexamine the next witnessit quite makes my forehead ache alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the listfeeling very curious to see what the next witness would be likefor they havent got much evidence yet she said to herselfimagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the topof his shrill little voice the name alice chapter xii alices evidence here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of themoment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and shejumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox withthe edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the headsof the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about remindingher very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upsetthe week before oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of greatdismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she couldfor the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head andshe had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at onceand put back into the jurybox or they would die the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very gravevoice until all the jurymen are back in their proper placesall he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice ashe said do alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste shehad put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thingwas waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unableto move she soon got it out again and put it right not thatit signifies much she said to herself i should think itwould be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock ofbeing upset and their slates and pencils had been found andhanded back to them they set to work very diligently to writeout a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemedtoo much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth opengazing up into the roof of the court what do you know about this business the king said toalice nothing said alice nothing whatever persisted the king nothing whatever said alice thats very important the king said turning to the jurythey were just beginning to write this down on their slates whenthe white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty meansof course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning andmaking faces at him as he spoke unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said andwent on to himself in an undertone importantunimportantunimportantimportant as if he were trying which wordsounded best some of the jury wrote it down important and someunimportant alice could see this as she was near enough tolook over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit shethought to herself at this moment the king who had been for some time busilywriting in his notebook cackled out silence and read outfrom his book rule fortytwo all persons more than a milehigh to leave the court everybody looked at alice im not a mile high said alice you are said the king nearly two miles high added the queen well i shant go at any rate said alice besidesthats not a regular rule you invented it just now its the oldest rule in the book said the king then it ought to be number one said alice the king turned pale and shut his notebook hastilyconsider your verdict he said to the jury in a low tremblingvoice theres more evidence to come yet please your majesty saidthe white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper hasjust been picked up whats in it said the queen i havent opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seemsto be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody it must have been that said the king unless it waswritten to nobody which isnt usual you know who is it directed to said one of the jurymen it isnt directed at all said the white rabbit in facttheres nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paperas he spoke and added it isnt a letter after all its a setof verses are they in the prisoners handwriting asked another ofthe jurymen no theyre not said the white rabbit and thats thequeerest thing about it the jury all looked puzzled he must have imitated somebody elses hand said the kingthe jury all brightened up again please your majesty said the knave i didnt write it andthey cant prove i did theres no name signed at the end if you didnt sign it said the king that only makes thematter worse you must have meant some mischief or else youdhave signed your name like an honest man there was a general clapping of hands at this it was thefirst really clever thing the king had said that day that proves his guilt said the queen it proves nothing of the sort said alice why you donteven know what theyre about read them said the king the white rabbit put on his spectacles where shall i beginplease your majesty he asked begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go ontill you come to the end then stop these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it dont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yetsaid the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury if any one of them can explain it said alice she hadgrown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bitafraid of interrupting him ill give him sixpence i dontbelieve theres an atom of meaning in it the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesnt believetheres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted toexplain the paper if theres no meaning in it said the king that saves aworld of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any andyet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on hisknee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see somemeaning in them after all said i could not swim youcant swim can you he added turning to the knave the knave shook his head sadly do i look like it he saidwhich he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard all right so far said the king and he went on mutteringover the verses to himself we know it to be true thatsthe jury of course i gave her one they gave him two whythat must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on they all returned from him to you saidalice why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing tothe tarts on the table nothing can be clearer than thatthen againbefore she had this fit you never had fits mydear i think he said to the queen never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at thelizard as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left offwriting on his slate with one finger as he found it made nomark but he now hastily began again using the ink that wastrickling down his face as long as it lasted then the words dont fit you said the king looking roundthe court with a smile there was a dead silence its a pun the king added in an offended tone andeverybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict theking said for about the twentieth time that day no no said the queen sentence firstverdict afterwards stuff and nonsense said alice loudly the idea of havingthe sentence first hold your tongue said the queen turning purple i wont said alice off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voicenobody moved who cares for you said alice she had grown to her fullsize by this time youre nothing but a pack of cards at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flyingdown upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and halfof anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying onthe bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gentlybrushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from thetrees upon her face wake up alice dear said her sister why what a longsleep youve had oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she toldher sister as well as she could remember them all these strangeadventures of hers that you have just been reading about andwhen she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was acurious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea itsgetting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while sheran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning herhead on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking oflittle alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too begandreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again thetiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyeswere looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of hervoice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep backthe wandering hair that would always get into her eyesandstill as she listened or seemed to listen the whole placearound her became alive the strange creatures of her littlesisters dream the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurriedbythe frightened mouse splashed his way through theneighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups asthe march hare and his friends shared their neverending mealand the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunateguests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on theduchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itoncemore the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizardsslatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigsfilled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserablemock turtle so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself inwonderland though she knew she had but to open them again andall would change to dull realitythe grass would be onlyrustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of thereedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheepbells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherdboyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon andall the other queer noises would change she knew to theconfused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of thecattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtlesheavy sobs lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister ofhers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and howshe would keep through all her riper years the simple andloving heart of her childhood and how she would gather abouther other little children and make their eyes bright and eagerwith many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream ofwonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all theirsimple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joysremembering her own childlife and the happy summer days the end'"
